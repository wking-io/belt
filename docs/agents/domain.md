# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root.
- **`docs/adr/`** for decisions that touch the area being changed.

If any of these files don't exist, proceed silently. The producer skill (`/grill-with-docs`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions are resolved.

## File structure

This is a single-context repo:

```txt
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
└── packages/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When output names a domain concept, use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding.
